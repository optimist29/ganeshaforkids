    story: `Once upon a time, in the heavenly realms, there lived Bala Ganapathi, who appeared as a beautiful child with the wisdom of ages. His hands were always full of the sweetest fruits - bananas, mangoes, jackfruits, and sugarcane - and his favorite modaka sweets.

    Children from all over the world would come to play with Bala Ganapathi because he understood their hearts perfectly. He would share his fruits and sweets with everyone, teaching them that sharing makes everything taste better.

    One day, a little boy named Ravi was sad because he had no toys to play with. Bala Ganapathi appeared before him, glowing like the morning sun, with his hands full of delicious treats.

    "Why are you sad, little friend?" asked Bala Ganapathi with a voice as sweet as honey.

    "I have no toys," replied Ravi.

    Bala Ganapathi smiled and said, "The best toys are not things you can buy. Look around you!" He showed Ravi how to make toys from leaves, how to play games with stones, and how imagination could turn anything into an adventure.

    From that day, Ravi learned that happiness comes from within, and like Bala Ganapathi, he shared his joy with everyone he met.`,

    Taruna Ganapathi appeared to her in a dream, his red form radiating energy like the rising sun. "Why do you look so tired, young one?" he asked, his voice full of vigor.

    "I've lost my excitement for learning," Priya confessed. "Everything feels difficult and boring."

    Taruna Ganapathi smiled and showed her his hands - one holding his broken tusk, another holding fresh fruits, and others holding tools of learning. "See, dear child, I carry both my sacrifices and my rewards. True enthusiasm comes when we remember why we started our journey."

    He taught her that youthful energy isn't about being carefree, but about approaching challenges with excitement and determination. From that day, Priya approached her studies with renewed vigor, seeing each lesson as an adventure rather than a chore.`,

    A little boy named Arjun wanted to pray to Ganesha but felt sad because his family couldn't afford expensive offerings for the temple. He watched other families bring elaborate gifts while he had only a small flower he had picked from his garden.

    Bhakti Ganapathi, seeing the pure love in the child's heart, appeared before him in his radiant white form. "Why do you look worried, my dear child?" he asked gently.

    "I only have this small flower to offer you," Arjun said, holding up his simple gift. "Others bring so many expensive things."

    Bhakti Ganapathi smiled warmly and accepted the flower. As soon as he touched it, the simple flower began to glow with divine light, more beautiful than any expensive offering.

    "Dear Arjun," he said, "the value of an offering is not in its price, but in the love with which it is given. Your single flower, offered with pure devotion, is more precious to me than a thousand costly gifts given without love."

    From that day, Arjun understood that true devotion comes from the heart, and every prayer offered with love reaches the divine.`,

    A young girl named Kavya was being bullied at school. The older children would take her lunch, tear her books, and make her afraid to go to school. She felt helpless and scared, not knowing how to defend herself.

    One night, as Kavya cried herself to sleep, Veera Ganapathi appeared in her dreams, his multiple arms gleaming with divine weapons, his presence radiating strength and protection.

    "Why do you weep, brave child?" asked the warrior divine, his voice strong yet gentle.

    "I'm not brave," Kavya sobbed. "I'm scared of the bullies at school. I don't know how to fight them."

    Veera Ganapathi knelt down to her level, his weapons transforming into symbols of inner strength. "True courage, dear one, is not about fighting with weapons. It's about standing up for what is right, speaking the truth, and asking for help when you need it."

    He taught her that real warriors protect others, speak up against injustice, and use their strength to help, not hurt. The next day, Kavya found the courage to tell her teacher about the bullying, and together they solved the problem peacefully.

    Veera Ganapathi had shown her that the greatest weapon is a brave heart filled with righteousness.`,

    lesson: "True power comes from balancing different energies and working together in harmony.",
    story: `In the sacred realm where divine energies dance together, Shakti Ganapathi sat in perfect harmony with his beloved Shakti. His red form glowed with power, while his four arms showed both strength and gentleness, demonstrating that true power comes from balance.

    Two friends, Raj and Meera, were working on a school project together, but they kept arguing. Raj wanted to do everything his way because he thought boys were better at building things, while Meera felt her ideas weren't being heard because she was a girl.

    Their constant fighting was getting them nowhere, and their project was falling apart. Frustrated, they both wished for help to work together better.

    That night, Shakti Ganapathi appeared to them in their dreams, his divine form embracing his Shakti, showing perfect cooperation and mutual respect.

    "Why do you fight when you could create something beautiful together?" asked Shakti Ganapathi, his voice carrying both strength and compassion.

    "We're too different," said Raj. "We can't agree on anything."

    "But differences make us stronger," replied Shakti Ganapathi. "See how I embrace my Shakti? We are different but equal, each bringing unique gifts. When masculine and feminine energies work together, they create something more powerful than either could alone."

    He showed them how his strength was balanced by his Shakti's wisdom, how his action was guided by her intuition. The children learned that their different perspectives weren't obstacles but gifts that could make their project extraordinary.

    The next day, Raj and Meera combined their different strengths and created the best project in their class, understanding that true power comes from unity, not dominance.`,
